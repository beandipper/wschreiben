- Shortest path algos in hypergraphs

- Which algos are available?
-- (2015) HyperEdge-based Dynamic Shortest Path Algorithm(HE-DSP by Gao et al) [1]
-- (2015) DR-DSP by Gao et al [1]
-- (1993) Extended Dijkstra(Gallo et al.) [2]
--- Applies to B-Hypergraphs
--- Weighted Hypergraph
--- NP-Hard but some cases where easy to solve
--- Assume: Restricted to additive weighting functions
--- Assume: Arc weights are nonnegative
--- Assume: All cycles are nondecreasing
-- (1992) Semi-dynamic minimum length (Ausiello et al.)[3]
--- Approaces NP-hard w/ measure-function on hyperpaths must be value-based
-- (1992) An incremental algorithm for a generalization of the shortest-path problem(Ramalingam) [4]
--- Poses problem as grammar problem
--- Assume: nonnegative edge lengths
--- Dynamic
--- SSSP(Single-source shortest-path problem)
--- Special case of the Dynamic SSF-G Algo


- Types of shortest path problems
-- static ~> extended Dijkstras algo
-- dynamic

- Types of hypergraphs
-- General ~> Gallo's algo
-- Special case ~> Knuth's & Ramalingam
-- Directed Hypergraphs ~> Ausiello  


- Why are the different classes of Algos?
-- fully dynamic 

- What are the uses?

- Notes
-- Hypergraph ~= context free Grammar
-- Hyperarcs ~= Production
-- Nodes ~= nonterminals
-- Hyperpath ~= derivation
-- Hyperpath from empty set of nodes to a node ~= Derivation of terminal string from nonterminal
-- Hyperpaths from nonempty set of nodes to node ~= partial derivations
